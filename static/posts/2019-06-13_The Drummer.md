# Meet the band: The Drummer

<em> posted on the 13th of June 2019 </em>

My name is Christopher and as of this writing I'm 30 years old and started playing drums when I was 10.

I stopped practicing drums actively by the age of 17 to become a vocalist in a death metal band that split a year later. I gave up on playing in bands by the age of 20.

I joined CRYOSPHERE in August 2018 after they had been looking for a new drummer for some time.
Had it not been for my friend to push me to try auditioning for the band I probably never would have played drums again for the rest of my life.

#### Auditioning for the band


They sent me a demo of the song Wolves & Kings to practice at home. Unfortunately I didn't have a drumkit so I was learning the song by slapping my thighs and tapping the floor with my feet.

On the day of the audition I sat down in front of a drumkit for the first time in 10 years, hit the sticks 4 times and off we went.
