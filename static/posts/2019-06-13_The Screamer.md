Hi, I'm Anders!

#### Auditioning
I was in another band with Emil before we both became part of CRYOSPHERE. That band ended up disbanding. In that time Emil had secretly joined CRYOSPHERE without telling me!

However one night in February 2017 Emil calls me and asks me if I was sad he had joined another band without telling me. I was just happy for him, I knew he was great guitar player so his talents shouldn't go to waste in a band that wasn't working.
He then asked me to come audition as a screamer for the band.

I thought I might as well try it out!

The audition went great and Sirene and the guys were pleased with my performance and asked me to join the band.

The songs I performed were "Laid to Rest" by Lamb of God and "The Lines" by Beartooth.
