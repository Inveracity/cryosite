#### The beginning

Oh hi! I'm Glen, the rythm guitarist of the band CRYOSPHERE. I've been playing guitar since the age of 12.
As a youngling, alot of musical influences were brought onto me be my surroundings, but as I grew older I was in dire need of something more grim, and I sought out <em>the metal</em>.
I am completely self taught and I learned the instrument by listening closely to the music and then tried copying each individual note carefully.
Later on in my life I discoved the thrill of the theory of music, and taught myself once again.

#### Enter the CRYOSPHERE

I've been creating music on my own for quite some time now, but now I'm privileged to work with the creation of music in the company of the fellow melodymakers of the band.
